# CCNA Layer 2 Switching Lab

A simulated enterprise Layer 2 network built in Cisco Packet Tracer, applying core concepts from **CCNA Chapter 2** and beyond.

## üß† Lab Objectives

- Build a scalable Layer 2 network using best practices
- Practice VLAN creation and segmentation
- Configure EtherChannel for redundancy and load balancing
- Prevent loops using Spanning Tree Protocol
- Manage VLANs via VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)
- Enable Inter-VLAN routing on a multilayer switch
- Implement remote switch management via SSH

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **VLANs**: 10 (HR), 20 (IT), 30 (Sales), 99 (Management), 100 (Servers)
- **VTP**: Server/Client mode for centralized VLAN management
- **STP**: Loop prevention and redundancy across Distribution switches
- **LACP (EtherChannel)**: Port-channeling across distribution and core
- **802.1Q Trunking**: VLAN tagging on trunk links
- **SSH**: Remote switch management from a laptop in VLAN 99
- **Core Gateway**: Multilayer switch performing Inter-VLAN routing and serving as default gateway
- **Trunk Security**: Trunks to server switches limited to VLAN 100 only

## üìå Notes

- Management VLAN (99) used for switch IP assignment and SSH access
- Laptops and PCs are assigned to VLANs according to department
- IP Phones use voice VLANs alongside data VLANs

## üöÄ Skills Demonstrated

- Network segmentation
- Redundancy & convergence planning
- Centralized VLAN control
- Layer 2 security and access
- Remote management and SSH hardening
